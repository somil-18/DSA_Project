# DSA_Project
This is a project that I have made in my 2nd semester of BTech CSE. In this project, i have tried to create a menu driven approach for all the operations of Data Structures like array, linked list, stack, queue. In non-linear DS, I have tried traversal operation in Binary trees with Searching and Sorting algorithms.  I have tried my best :)
